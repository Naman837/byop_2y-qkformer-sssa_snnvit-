# Spiking Vision Transformer Routes for Event-Based Vision
This project contains multiple architectural implementations of a Spiking Neural Network–based Vision Transformer (SNN-ViT) evaluated on the CIFAR10-DVS event-based vision dataset.
I have implemented architectures from 2 different research papers and combining them to create 4 distinct routes and compared them
# Environment Setup
## Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.8

* PyTorch

* snntorch
* aedat
* Ipython

* sklearn

* tonic

* timm

* numpy

* matplotlib

# Running the Code
Each architectural route is implemented as a separate Colab notebook.

You can run each cell by cell in Google colab ,the requirements will be downloaded along the way.

If you are running this in jupyter or other notebook make sure to download all required libraries.
